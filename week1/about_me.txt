I decided to learn CLoud Computing because i wanted to 
understand how modern applications are hosted and scaled.

I realized that knowing how to deploy, manage, and secure 
applications in the cloud is an essential skill for any backend developer. 
Learning cloud platforms also allows me to work on real-world projects andprepare 
for future remote work opportunities.
