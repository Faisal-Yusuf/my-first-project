My Cloud Computing Programming Goals:

1. Learn a programming language commonly used in cloud development:
   - Python (automation, serverless functions)
   - JavaScript/Node.js (backend APIs)

2. Understand Git and version control:
   - Use GitHub to manage cloud projects
   - Learn branching, commits, and pull requests

3. Master Linux and command-line basics:
   - Navigation, file management, permissions
   - Bash scripting for automation

4. Learn networking fundamentals:
   - IP addresses, ports, DNS
   - HTTP/HTTPS, firewalls, security groups

5. Get familiar with a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP):
   - Deploy virtual servers (EC2 or equivalent)
   - Use object storage (S3, Blob Storage)
   - Work with serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
   - Set up databases (RDS, DynamoDB, Cloud SQL)

6. Learn DevOps basics:
   - Docker for containerization
   - CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
   - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)

7. Build cloud projects:
   - Host a website on cloud storage
   - Deploy a REST API on a cloud server
   - Automate tasks with serverless functions
   - Integrate monitoring/logging tools

8. Focus on cloud security and best practices:
   - Manage IAM roles and permissions
   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit
   - Set up backup and disaster recovery

9. Contribute to open-source or real-world cloud projects
10. Continuously update knowledge as cloud platforms evolve
